# Toggle profile threads
The ability to show and hide threads on your profile.

## Why?
Why would you want such a thing? I don't know about you, but certain threads make supporting the forums unpleasant. 
This could be because I've replied terribly in a thread and I don't want to be reminded of it every time I visit my profile page. 

## How does it work?
There's a button to show and hide this functionality. This appears in the profile menu links, i.e. underneath the "Favourite" link. Pressing this button will toggle the actual 'toggle profile threads' functionality.

The functionality to toggle the profile threads is available in the "x" and "show" buttons beside each thread. Pressing "x" will hide the thread from view. Pressing "show" will return the thread from view.

Note that this utilises local storage.
